## Why Another CLI Task Manager?

[Taskwarrior] has been the gold standard for CLI task managers so far.
However, I repeatedly lost tasks due to [weird bugs]
and syncing issues.
I also found several UI decisions inept and wanted something
with a better workflow.
But probably most importantly I couldn't see myself contributing
to a C++ project.
I had been working with C++ at university and it wasn't pleasant.

To sum it up: I finally wanted something which I could fully own
and use until the end of days.
That means:

- Does not suddenly get bought by a bigger fish and get closed down
    or made unusable (looking at you [Wunderlist])
- Is written in a high-performance programming language,
    yet gives me lot's of guarantees about the code's stability
    and makes it easy for other developers to contribute
- Free software
- With a stable, future proof, powerful, and fast backend
    (currently [SQLite], but support for plain files and Git is planned)

## Why Not [Org-mode]?

I don't like the unstructured combination of outlining, notes and tasks.
Furthermore I don't like interactive document editing UIs in the terminal.
I prefer REPL style apps which adhere to UNIX conventions and let
me compose them easily with other CLI tools.

This, however, is just a personal preference
and otherwise [Org-mode] is certainly a good solution.
Also check out [Smos],
which is another powerful tree-based editor with extra focus
on [Getting Things Done].
