If TaskLite isn't your cup of tea, maybe one of the other free task managers
fits the bill:

- [Buku] - Store and manage your bookmarks from the command line.
- [CommitTasks] - Combination between git commit and todo list.
- [Eureka] - CLI tool to input and store ideas without leaving the terminal.
- [Ff] - A distributed note taker and task manager.
- [Org mode] - Notes and todo lists powered by an Emacs based plain-text system.
- [Smos] - Purely functional semantic tree-based editor (similar to [Org mode]).
- [Taskbook] - Tasks, boards & notes for the command-line habitat.
- [Taskwarrior] - Commandline Task Management.
- [Toodles] - Project management from the TODO's in your codebase.
